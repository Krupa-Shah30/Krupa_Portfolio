# A/B Testing Basics

A/B testing is a randomized experiment comparing two variants. Key concepts:

- **Randomization**: Ensures unbiased assignment.
- **Power**: Probability of detecting a true effect.
- **Metrics**: Choose actionable, sensitive KPIs.
- **CUPED**: Pre-experiment variance reduction.

<Callout kind="tip">Always pre-register your hypotheses and metrics.</Callout>

<Metric value="â†‘ 15% conversion" />
